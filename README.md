🛒 Cart App (Vanilla JavaScript)

A lightweight and fully functional shopping cart web application built using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS). The application uses Browser LocalStorage to persist cart data, allowing users to retain their selected items even after refreshing or reopening the page.

This project demonstrates core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, state management without frameworks, and client-side data persistence.

🚀 Features:
 🧾 Add products to cart
 ➕ Increase / ➖ decrease item quantity
 ❌ Remove items from cart
 💾 Persistent cart data using LocalStorage
 🔄 Cart state remains after page refresh
 📱 Responsive and clean UI
 ⚡ Built with pure JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)

🛠️ Technologies Used
 * HTML5 – Structure of the application
 * CSS3 – Styling and layout
 * JavaScript (ES6) – Application logic
 * LocalStorage API – Client-side data storage

└── README.md         # Project documentation

📦 How It Works:
* Products are dynamically rendered using JavaScript.
* When a user adds an item to the cart, the data is stored in LocalStorage.
* Cart items are retrieved from LocalStorage on page load.
* Quantity updates and removals automatically update both UI and LocalStorage.
* No backend or database is required.
